A site built in Python using the Django library that allows a restaurant to let customers order its dishes.

Ordering is done by e-mail. This solution is designed for small businesses that cannot spend a lot of money on creating a more efficient website.
Thanks to the Django library, the administrator can insert his own dishes completely independently and very easily without the help of a programmer.

Should anyone need it, please contact me so that I can help you for FREE to realise your site with this template of mine.
