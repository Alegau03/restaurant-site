A site built in Python using the Django library that allows a restaurant to let customers order its dishes.

Ordering is done by e-mail. This solution is designed for small businesses that cannot spend a lot of money on creating a more efficient website.
Thanks to the Django library, the administrator can insert his own dishes completely independently and very easily without the help of a programmer.

Should anyone need it, please contact me so that I can help you for FREE to realise your site with this template of mine.

!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
The site is all in Italian, if anyone would like to try it out, they can contact me and I will provide the translation.

To try the site download all the files, on the cmd write "python manage.py runserver" and connect to the address localhost:8000/rolls
